            A fundamental challenge for behavioral neuroscientists is to accurately
            quantify (dis)similarities in animal behavior without excluding inherent
            variability present between individuals. We explored two new applications of
            curve and shape alignment techniques to address this issue.
            As a proof-of-concept we applied these methods to compare normal or alarmed behavior in
            pairs of medaka (Oryzias latipes). The curve alignment method we call
            Behavioral Distortion Distance (BDD) revealed that alarmed fish display less
            predictable swimming over time, even if individuals incorporate the same action
            patterns like immobility, sudden changes in swimming trajectory, or changing their
            position in the water column. The Conformal Spatiotemporal Distance (CSD) technique on
            the other hand revealed that, in spite of the unpredictability, alarmed individuals exhibit
            lower variability in overall swim patterns, possibly accounting for the widely held notion
            of “stereotypy” in alarm responses. More generally, we propose that these new applications of
            established computational geometric techniques are useful in combination to represent, compare,
            and quantify complex behaviors consisting of common action patterns that differ in duration, sequence,
            or frequency.
